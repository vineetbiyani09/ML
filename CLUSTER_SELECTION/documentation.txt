The input y may be either a 1-D condensed distance matrix or a 2-D array of observation vectors.
n is the number of original observations paired in the distance matrix. 
A (n−1) by 4 matrix Z is returned. At the i-th iteration, clusters with indices Z[i, 0] and Z[i, 1] are combined to form cluster n+i. A cluster with an index less than n corresponds to one of the n original observations. The distance between clusters Z[i, 0] and Z[i, 1] is given by Z[i, 2]. The fourth value Z[i, 3] represents the number of original observations in the newly formed cluster.
A distance matrix is maintained at each iteration. The d[i, j] entry corresponds to the distance between cluster i and j in the original forest.
At each iteration, the algorithm must update the distance matrix to reflect the distance of the newly formed cluster u with the remaining clusters in the forest.
The following are methods for calculating the distance between the newly formed cluster u and each v.
•	method=’single’ assigns
d(u,v)=min(dist(u[i],v[j]))
for all points i in cluster u and j in cluster v. 
•	method=’complete’ assigns
d(u,v)=max(dist(u[i],v[j]))
for all points i in cluster u and j in cluster v.
•	method=’average’ assigns
d(u,v)=∑ijd(u[i],v[j])(|u|∗|v|)
for all points i and j where |u| and |v| are the cardinalities of clusters u and v, respectively. 
•	method=’weighted’ assigns
d(u,v)=(dist(s,v)+dist(t,v))/2
where cluster u was formed with cluster s and t and v is a remaining cluster in the forest.

Pairwise distances between observations in n-dimensional space.
The following are common calling conventions.
1.	Y = pdist(X, ‘euclidean’) 
Computes the distance between m points using Euclidean distance (2-norm) as the distance metric between the points. The points are arranged as m n-dimensional row vectors in the matrix X.

2.	Y = pdist(X, ‘minkowski’, p=2) 
Computes the distances using the Minkowski distance ||u−v||p (p-norm) where p≥1.

3.	Y = pdist(X, ‘cityblock’) 
Computes the city block or Manhattan distance between the points.

4.	Y = pdist(X, ‘seuclidean’, V=None) 
Computes the standardized Euclidean distance. The standardized Euclidean distance between two n-vectors u and v is
∑(ui−vi)2/V[xi]
V is the variance vector; V[i] is the variance computed over all the i’th components of the points. If not passed, it is automatically computed.
The dendrogram illustrates how each cluster is composed by drawing a U-shaped link between a non-singleton cluster and its children. The top of the U-link indicates a cluster merge. The two legs of the U-link indicate which clusters were merged. The length of the two legs of the U-link represents the distance between the child clusters. It is also the cophenetic distance between original observations in the two children clusters.
